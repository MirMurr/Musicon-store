# CodeCademy - Musicon store project with handlebars.js
    
     Part of the design (layout) and images were provided by CodeCademy. I added media queries to the CSS so that it renders properly on mobile devices as           well. I added hamburger menu for navbar on smaller screen sizes.
    I applied handlebars.js to create reusable HTML templates.

## My process

### Built with

## What I learned

- using handlebars.js to create reusable HTML templates.

- lock scroll when mobile menu is active 

```js

hamburger.addEventListener("click", () => {
    hamburger.classList.toggle("active");
    navMenu.classList.toggle("active");

    document.body.classList.toggle('lock-scroll');
});

```
```css
.lock-scroll {
    overflow: hidden;
}

```

### Continued development

I am working on the following skills:

- Javascript skills (handlebars.js, functions)
- JS handlebars library
- Positioning elements - responsive mode
